# Distributional Gradient Matching for Learning Uncertain Neural Dynamics Models - USHCN experiments


This repository contains code for reproducing the USHCN experiments of the PhD thesis of Philippe Wenk. This repository contains two code bases.

gru_ode_bayes is used for preprocessing and has been built using the [github repository](https://github.com/edebrouwer/gru_ode_bayes) published alongside the paper [GRU-ODE-Bayes: Continuous modeling of sporadically-observed time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12374). Please cite their work when using this code.

DGM_Extension contains a modified version of the [DGM algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11609), with adaptation as described in the PhD thesis of Philippe Wenk.
